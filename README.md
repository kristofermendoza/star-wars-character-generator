# star-wars-character-generator

I implemented a Star Wars API and created a random character generator.
Challenges I faced during this project:
  Using my own custom font,
    I wanted to use a Star Wars font and I had to learn to use a certain font class in CSS in order to use the custom font I wanted
NOTE: Because of the API, some of the images will not show on my website, it is a bug I hope to fix.
